# Resource-Monitoring
This project, arising from recent research at the Wolfson Schoolâ€™s Centre for Sustainable Manufacturing and Recycling Technologies (SMART), aimed to create a prototype novel software platform for manufacturers which had commercial potential. The software would also provide a route to market for digital tools arising from the same research, following further development.
